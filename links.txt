GOPchop is a "Graphical MPEG Clipper" - a Linux-based GUI program for removing
sections from a video file with the minimum amount of disturbance to the
stream.  It does this by writing specific "Group of Pictures" (GOP) sections
to a new video file.  The GOPs will decode correctly and the gaps won't be
noticed.
