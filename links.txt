https://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Commercial_detection_with_Comskip.exe_and_Wine

Comskip is a free mpeg commercial detector.  It is a windows console
application that reads a mpeg file and analyses the content based on a large
amount of configurable parameters.  After analysis it generates a file in
various possible formats containing the location of the commercials inside the
mpeg file.

GOPchop is a "Graphical MPEG Clipper" - a Linux-based GUI program for removing
sections from a video file with the minimum amount of disturbance to the
stream.  It does this by writing specific "Group of Pictures" (GOP) sections
to a new video file.  The GOPs will decode correctly and the gaps won't be
noticed.
